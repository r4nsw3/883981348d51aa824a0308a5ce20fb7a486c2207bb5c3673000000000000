  |   Can you grow the biggest Sparkle in the world?                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Subtle, captivating, addictive. These three words describe the        |
  |   world of Sparkle - world in which you make a tiny aquatic creature    |
  |   evolve into becoming a grown, magnificent being.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We give you control over your Sparkle's development and wellbeing,    |
  |   and you have one goal - to evolve. Whilst exploring the Sparkle       |
  |   Void, you find various nutritious elements to eat. Sometimes you      |
  |   will even have to fight for food with other species. You become       |
  |   what you eat - you get to choose whether your sparkle becomes a       |
  |   fast and aggressive carnivore, a sluggish but fast-eating             |
  |   herbivore, or an omnivore, whose features lie somewhere in between.   |
  |   Insight to your Sparkle's DNA strand will give you information        |
  |   about the progress and will help you plan which microelements you     |
  |   want to focus on eating next. You will also get to fight giant        |
  |   bosses from time to time.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But there's no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times.      |
  |   You may as well just relax, play the game on a slow pace, explore     |
  |   the sparkle void, consume nutritional elements, enjoy simple and      |
  |   surreal surrounding and listen to the ambient music soundtrack. The   |
  |   choice is all yours.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
